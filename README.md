# Linked-Binary-Search-Tree-CS-302

Linked Binary Search Tree implemented in C++ with the original assignment prompt being as follows:

Randomly generate 100 unique values in the range of [1-200] and insert them into a binary search tree (BST).
Print height and inorder, preorder, and postoder output of the BST tree. Deliver source code and a test file
that shows the result of printing height and inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal.
